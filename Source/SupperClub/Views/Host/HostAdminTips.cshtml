    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Help finding a space</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Need help finding the perfect venue? Grub Club is happy to help. For more information please email inquiries to olivia@Grubclub.com.</li>
                <li>Please be aware that a deposit will need to be paid directly to the venue if you decide to book. This will be agreed directly with the venue.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Connect with other chefs and volunteers</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Please contact <a href="mailto:olivia@Grubclub.com">olivia@Grubclub.com</a> with any inquiries.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b> Help us help you, sending marketing info to Grub Club:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Before we send you off with this checklist please make sure you send answers to the following 2 questions to siddarth@Grubclub.com, answering in as much detail as possible. These answers will enable us to help you by distinguishing certain details about your event and your target market and help promote it.

                    <ol>
                        <li>Who is your target market? (General age, sex, occupation, interests etc.)</li>
                        <li>Which Press Outlets would you expect to be interested in your project? (Local press, national press, online and print outlets etc.)</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Market event &amp; send guests event link for bookings:</b>
            <p>Grub Club does help with marketing, however it’s very important for hosts to take ownership of their own campaigns and view Grub Club only as added support. Why’s that?</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Well, you are the best judge of the essence of what you represent, who your audience is and what might make you stand out to them. You’re actually better placed than we are to appeal directly to your target market.</li>
                <li>Furthermore, as we expand, so will our reach, with customers coming naturally to the site to search events. Unfortunately this takes time but we are working very hard to build up consumer interest and trust.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="text-success">Think you need more marketing tips? Lucky we’ve put something together for you at the end of this information pack!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Summarising guest information:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Grub Club can only summarise guest details, communicate with them and process their payment if they book through Grub Club so please ensure you send your guests a link to your Grub Club event page. If you tell them to email/call you, it will make your planning and preparation a lot more complicated!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Monitoring your bookings online:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Dietary Requirements: Please check your guests’ dietary requirements. This will be in each email booking you receive but is also summarised on your event page. To find them, go to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>“Guest” tab in your event page</li>
                        <li>“Full guest info” at the bottom of the guest list (see image below)</li>
                        <img src="@Url.Content("~/Content/images/dietary requirements.jpg")" alt="Guest info location on page">
                    </ul>

                </li>
                <li><b>Reserved seats:</b> Please keep track of the number of reserved seats you set aside. Grub Club may also reserve seats on your behalf in that same box, in case we can sell seats on your behalf through other channels. We’ll confirm to you when those bookings have actually been finalised. This means reserved seats may actually change at different times, which is why it’s important for you to remember how many you’ve manually reserved yourself.</li>

                <li><b>Change of location:</b> We strongly recommend you stick to your original venue, however if a location does need to change, you must tell Grub Club IMMEDIATELY about this, so guests can be informed of the change of venue. Upon booking, guests receive a confirmation email with location details, so we need to let the guests know of any changes as soon as possible. You will also need to offer the option of refunding guests if the location suddenly becomes inconvenient to attend.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Updating your bank details online:</b>
            <p>
                Once your account has been created online, you will need to update your bank details so we can pay you. Go to: <br>

                My Account (top of page) > My Grub Club Details > Banking > Edit > Enter your bank details > Press Update (left of page).
            </p>
            <p>Please let Liv (<a href="mailto:Olivia@Grubclub.com">Olivia@Grubclub.com</a>) or Sid (<a href="mailto:Siddarth@grubclub.com">Siddarth@Grubclub.com</a>) know once you’ve updated your bank details or if you ever change them.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <div class="panel">
        <p class="lobster"><span class="text-danger">Don’t forget:</span> Once your Grub Club has been created, we will provide you with an Event page URL</p> <p>(eg. http://www.Grubclub.com/Event/Details?eventId=200)</p> <p>Your URL will be where your customers can read about your event and book tickets. Be sure to use your event’s unique URL to advertise and promote and of course guide people to booking tickets!</p>
