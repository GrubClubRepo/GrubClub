			<h1 align="left">Hello Fellow Trotters!</h1>
  				So what’s this all about?<br/><br/>Nose to Tail Fortnight raises awareness among Chefs and Foodies alike of the  benefits of eating the whole animal and rediscovering the food that it surrounds.<br/><br/>The aim of the campaign is to:<br/>
				<ul>
				<li>Reduce food waste involved in the meat and wider food chain</li>
				<li>Encourage greater respect for the food we eat</li>
				<li>Raise awareness of recipes and alternative methods of cooking that will help us enjoy all the varieties of meat and forgotten foods. </li>
				</ul>				
				Should I care?
				<br/><br/>
				Well some of the more unpalatable sounding cuts of meat are actually the most palatable bits!  
				<br/><br/>
				And for the more environmentally conscious among you; did you know that £440million of perfectly usable Pork goes into the rubbish bins each year?!!
				<br/><br/>
				Stop preaching start eating!

		We are four welcoming hostesses from bustling Brixton. Passionate about delicious food, meeting new people, and doing good in the world and we want to open up our house to you! All profits go to charity and the majority of ingredients used are sourced from surplus food donated by local suppliers. We aim to give you a meal to remember and make you proud in supporting a worthy charity. In as many ways as we can, we aim to truly Feed Your Soul...    <span id="p3" style="display:none">Our first themed dinner, Arabian Nights, will evoke a sense of the exotic and opulent. With the heady mix of incense and exotic spices in the air your welcoming hosts will indulge you with succulent dishes from varied Arabian cultures accompanied by innovative cocktails that complement the many rich and diverse flavours. All profits will go to the human rights charity, The Aire Centre. For more information, visit http://www.airecentre.org/.     We will also be supporting Grub Club's 'Nose-to-tail' fortnight by serving our take on an Algerian dish, Kebda M'chermoula with lamb's liver for starter. Do not be afraid! It is absolutely delicious and a great way to celebrate a more sustainable way of enjoying meat.     So, If you’re looking for a warm welcome, good company among new friends, and the chance to savour some of the best cuisine from exotic Arabian lands - then join us!    We are getting a lot of support from other organisations in the local area for food donations, promotion and advice. Please show your love and support and check the following links out...just to name a few:    http://bestbefore.org.uk/ : Best Before project aims to raise awareness about food labelling and to save edible food from destruction by encouraging business to either SELL the food at a discount or to DONATE to local charities or directly to Best Before Project for re-distribution. Please, remember that what we try to promote is that the food that pass its best before date is still edible to eat.    http://www.planzheroes.org/ : Connecting businesses which have surplus food with nearby charities that need it.     https://brixtonpk.wordpress.com/tag/food-waste/ : Inspired and supported by the wonderful People’s Kitchen (Passing Clouds, Dalston) Brixton People's Kitchen collects food that would otherwise be thrown away from local shops, markets and businesses, invites people to cook together in a local kitchen and afterwards welcomes everyone to enjoy a meal on a donations basis.

		In honour of London's very own Nose to Tail Week, The Wandering Chef is preparing a feast for the truest of meat lovers. Most butchers will graitutously hack at you meat just like the Ripper. <span id="p6" style="display:none">We however have decided to surgically slice the most sumptuous morsels from nose to tail to re-Veal the best of the beast.    Five courses of unexpected Veal based delights will be served in our pop-up operating theatre, so bring a visceral curiosity and we'll provide the scalpel!</span><span id="moreId6" style="cursor: pointer;color:#ff6600;" onclick="clickMore('moreId6','p6');">more..</span><br><br>

		Hill Street Chews offers informal butchery master classes in residential and bespoke venues. Born out of the philosophy that we all need a clearer understanding of our connection to the food we eat. As Bates says ‘If you can’t kill it, or grow it, don’t eat it’.  The need to know each connection of our meat and veg comes from new born beast or seed through to plate are fundamental to our physical and emotional well being. <span id="p8" style="display:none">About Us: we go by BATES & GILHESPY never Norm & Derek!  Derek Seth BATES - Chef and all round genius when it comes to food and beer – chef for Meat Wagon street food.  Recognised Beer Sommelier and founder of Dirty South Brewery.    Andrew Norman GILHESPY – Organic gardener, owner of citygardencoop.com an avid cook.     Following a small CSA (Community Sourced Agriculture) we set up to get non supermarket, fairly priced meat and to share our own vegetables back in Feb 2012.  By request from would be pupils, we started our small and informal events in April 2012 in order to spread our philosophy – to take seasonal ingredients and good quality whole carcasses and teach how to convert them into amazing things to eat.  Our events are designed for people to learn about butchery, learn some new recipes but also to meet like minded people and most importantly, to have a good time.     Students take whole animals, large (beef, lamb, pig) and small (duck, rabbit, dove) butcher them over the course of the day, cook with them and eat the result, learning how to take an animal from point of slaughter through it’s primal cuts, including gutting and skinning, and bone breaking, nothing hidden, to taking recognised butchers cuts home. Steaks, chops, Loins, Hams, Bacon, Ribs etc.  As well as a doggy back of meat you have prepared, we will also provide tasty snacks, made from the animal being butchered that day.     Nose to tail PIG:     Making the best use of a whole pig, for taste and budget. Two-day course (spilt in half) you will butcher the best organic pig in the UK from Blythewood farm. You will start with the whole beast and cut it down to primal cuts; loin, ribs, belly, shoulder, then further to finer cuts; chops, belly strips, loin. We will use the cuts nobody really knows what to do with, but are full of flavor; the head, the cheeks, the ears and the feet, and then to top it off we will make the finest sausages you ever did taste.     On the day or days (if you really are in it for the full run) you’ll have a lesson in how to butcher, one to one sessions with a Bates, our super South Carolina butcher, and then get to sample your handy work with a pig pit roast.     As you are learning how to butcher and are busy cutting into the beast we will be digging a pit and loading it with charcoal and wood and filling it with another beast, ready for after course feast…     This is a unique experience for those of you who want to get back in touch with their food.</span><span id="moreId8" style="cursor: pointer;color:#ff6600;" onclick="clickMore('moreId8','p8');">more..</span>     <br><br>

		Burst forth from the need to bring a truer form of meat enjoyment, and an appreciation for what beer can actually be, two fellows in South London Bates & Andy decided to start hosting bespoke butchery classes in various installations around the city. <span id="p12" style="display:none"> Bates a good ol'boy all the way from South Carolina formally trained chef and informally trained in the woods of the Deep South butchers anything that walks, swims, or flies and being an apprenticed brewer and accredited Beer Sommelier stretches the boundaries on his own beer and beers from around the world converting barley lovers and barley nay-sayers alike. Andy an avid organic gardner, earnest cook and owner of citygardencoop.com teams up to handle all things growing sprouting, flowering and generally setting down roots in terra firma. These two believe in getting elbow deep and dirty in their food and drink is not a passing fad but a birth right owed to those that want to eat better. <p>So with this ethos Bates and Andy will be hosting a butchery class for Nose to Tail Fortnight focusing on two of the lesser used, cheap and often squeamish inducing cuts of the hog the head and trotters. As a student you will first be taught how to trim a pigs head and then get in with your own head to carve up in order to learn the tasty little lessons of making a tete de fromage (headcheese). Next we will clean and split the trotters to create a messy, meat tendon and fat chewing delight of sticky trotters-no forks or knives allowed with this dish.</p><p> So come join us on June 16 as we set up shop in Dalston at the Waterhouse restaurant for piggy parts and beer, y'all be glad ya did.</p></span><span id="moreId12" style="cursor: pointer;color:#ff6600;" onclick="clickMore('moreId12','p12');">more..</span><br><br>
